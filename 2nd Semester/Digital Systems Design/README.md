## Digital Systems Design: 
Learned about bits, flip-flops, logic gates and the math behind it.
#### Projects: 
Had to do projects with Quartus program and VHDL.

**Project 1:** In this project we had to solve 3 problems by using mathematical tools like Karnaugh tables and later create a circuit to verify the result.

**Project 2:** We had to create an ALU circuit (Arithmetic logic unit) that can do basic binary functions and also addition and subtraction of numbers.

#### Projects: 
**Project 1:** The project was done in 6 parts/exercises. During these exercises, we set up an AWS postgre database using Airbnb data. Used SQL to create the tables and connect them properly, perform queries to answer questions, reconstruct the database design so it's normalized, creating diagrams to show the structure, perform more complex queries, creating triggers, indexes, views and more.

**Project 2:** Using imdb data we created another database with similar process to project 1. Constructed the database, created ER diagreams, answered certain questions using queries, extracting statistics from the database and more.

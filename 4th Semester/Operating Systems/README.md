## Operating Systems: 
OS structures, processes, threads, synchronization, CPU scheduling, deadlocks, main and virtual memory, storage systems, file systems, IO and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to do a project in C language. We used a virtual box with a certain linux version. 

**Project 1:** Creating an order system on a pizza shop, had to use POSIX threads and mutexes for the concept of bakers and ovens. There were random orders made in the shop and the shop had to satisfy them with productivity.

**Project 2:** In the second project we had to re-implement some of the code of the first project for a more complex operations of bakers/ovens.

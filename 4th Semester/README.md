## Algorithms: 
Asymptotic notation, complexity, divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, NP completeness and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to answer complex related questions in 2 sets of exercises. Create algorithms within the context of each question and prove mathematically what was requested.

## Automata and Complexity: 
Alphabets, strings, languages, Turing machines (deterministic, non-deterministic and their equivalence), halting problem and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to hand in small hand-written exercises.

## Databases: 
AWS, Constraints/Triggers, Design, ER Model, Indexing/IO, Hashing, Sorting, Relational Model, Transcations, SQL. 
#### Projects: 
**Project 1:** The project was done in 6 parts/exercises. During these exercises, we set up an AWS postgre database using Airbnb data. Used SQL to create the tables and connect them properly, perform queries to answer questions, reconstruct the database design so it's normalized, creating diagrams to show the structure, perform more complex queries, creating triggers, indexes, views and more.
**Project 2:** Using imdb data we created another database with similar process to project 1. Constructed the database, created ER diagreams, answered certain questions using queries, extracting statistics from the database and more.

## Operating Systems: 
OS structures, processes, threads, synchronization, CPU scheduling, deadlocks, main and virtual memory, storage systems, file systems, IO and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to do a project in C language. We used a virtual box with a certain linux version. 
**Project 1:** Creating an order system on a pizza shop, had to use POSIX threads and mutexes for the concept of bakers and ovens. There were random orders made in the shop and the shop had to satisfy them with productivity.
**Project 2:** In the second project we had to re-implement some of the code of the first project for a more complex operations of bakers/ovens.

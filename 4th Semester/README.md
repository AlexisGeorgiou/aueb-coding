Algorithms: Asymptotic notation, complexity, divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, NP completeness and more. 
Had to answer complex related questions in 2 sets of exercises. Create algorithms within the context of each question and prove mathematically what was requested.

Automata and Complexity: Alphabets, strings, languages, Turing machines (deterministic, non-deterministic and their equivalence), halting problem and more. Had to hand in small hand-written exercises.

Databases: AWS, Constraints/Triggers, Design, ER Model, Indexing/IO, Hashing, Sorting, Relational Model, Transcations, SQL. 
Had to setup an AWS database, design and build the database's model and analyze the data using SQL, given data from airbnb and later from imdb we extracted complex insights. Drew the models with draw.io tools. I did this with one of my classmates (group project).

Operating Systems:

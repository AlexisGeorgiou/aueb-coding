## Algorithms: 
Asymptotic notation, complexity, divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, NP completeness and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to answer complex related questions in 2 sets of exercises. Create algorithms within the context of each question and prove mathematically what was requested.

## Automata and Complexity: 
Alphabets, strings, languages, Turing machines (deterministic, non-deterministic and their equivalence), halting problem and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to hand in small hand-written exercises.

## Databases: 
AWS, Constraints/Triggers, Design, ER Model, Indexing/IO, Hashing, Sorting, Relational Model, Transcations, SQL. 
#### Projects: 
Had to setup an AWS database, design and build the database's model and analyze the data using SQL, given data from airbnb and later from imdb we extracted complex insights. Drew the models with draw.io tools. I did this with one of my classmates (group project).

## Operating Systems: 
OS structures, processes, threads, synchronization, CPU scheduling, deadlocks, main and virtual memory, storage systems, file systems, IO and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to do two projects in C language. 
Projects was about an order system on a pizza shop, had to use threads and mutexes for the concept of bakers and ovens. There were random orders made in the shop and the shop had to satisfy them with productivity.

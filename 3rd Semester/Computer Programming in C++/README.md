## Computer Programming in C++: 
Data types, Strings, Files, Functions, Classes, Libraries, Namespaces, Operators, Constructors, Inheritance, Templates and more concepts of the language. Had to complete one big project in C++. 
#### Projects:
The project was about building an command line application that reads images and applying various filters to them. We had to implement various classes, functions and a library. After implementing that, we had to implement various editing image filters. This was done in Visual Studio.

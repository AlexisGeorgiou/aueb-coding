I completed 3 projects in Java related to data structures with a classamate.

Project 1: Had to create a stack and a queue class and use them to implement a labyrinth algorithm (Thiseas)

Project 2: Had to create a priority queue and a disk class and then implement a greedy algorithm to save files on disks.

Project 3: Had to implement a coordinates system and other functionality, then use it to insert and search items on 2d-trees

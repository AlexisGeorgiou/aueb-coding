## Data Structures: 
Arrays, union-find, lists, algorithms, sorting methods, trees, queues, b-trees, hashing and more. 
#### Projects: 
**Project 1:** Had to create a stack and a queue class and use them to implement a labyrinth algorithm (Thiseas)

**Project 2:** Had to create a priority queue and a disk class and then implement a greedy algorithm to save files on disks.

**Project 3:** Had to implement a coordinates system and other functionality, then use it to insert and search items on 2d-trees

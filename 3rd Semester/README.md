## Computer Systems Organization: 
Logic, Arithmetics, Bits, Assembly MIPS and memory/performance theory. 
#### Projects: 
Was assigned two assembly projects, given a java code had to offer the same functionality in assembly.
**First project:** Calculating C(n, k) in Assembly.

**Second project:** Implementing a Hash table with MIPS32 Assembly Language.

## Data Structures: 
Arrays, union-find, lists, algorithms, sorting methods, trees, queues, b-trees, hashing and more. 
#### Projects: 
**Project 1:** Created a stack and a queue class and used them to implement a labyrinth algorithm (Thiseas)

**Project 2:** Created a priority queue and a disk class and then implemented a greedy algorithm to save files on disks.

**Project 3:** Implemented a coordinates system and other functionalities, then used them to insert and search items on 2d-trees

## Computer Programming in C++: 
Data types, Strings, Files, Functions, Classes, Libraries, Namespaces, Operators, Constructors, Inheritance, Templates and more concepts of the language. Had to complete one big project in C++. 
#### Projects:
The project was about building an command line application that reads images and applying various filters to them. We had to implement various classes, functions and a library. After implementing that, we had to implement various editing image filters. This was done in Visual Studio.

## Computational Mathematics: 
Errors and computer arithmeti, Algorithms and convergence. Hornerâ€™s method, differences and linear operators, polynomial interpolation, differentiation and integration, Matrix computations, differential equations, Numpy and more.

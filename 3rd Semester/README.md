Computer Systems Organization: Logic, Arithmetics, Bits, Assembly MIPS and memory/performance theory. Was assigned two assembly projects, given a java code had to offer the same functionality in assembly.

Data Structures: Arrays, union-find, lists, algorithms, sorting methods, trees, queues, b-trees, hashing and more. 

Computer Programming in C++: Data types, Strings, Files, Functions, Classes, Libraries, Namespaces, Operators, Constructors, Inheritance, Templates and more concepts of the language. Had to complete one big project in C++. The project was about reading images and applying various filters to them.

Computational Mathematics: Errors and computer arithmeti, Algorithms and convergence. Hornerâ€™s method, differences and linear operators, polynomial interpolation, differentiation and integration, Matrix computations, differential equations, Numpy and more

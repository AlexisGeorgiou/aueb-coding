In this course I learnt about the basics of programming concepts and basic python.
There were exercises in python.

hw1: Had to create functions using basic python.
hw2: Same as hw1 but I had to use more functionality like lambda functions.
hw3: Had to implement a little more complicated functions and also create a simple map-coordinates system with some functionality like "print_nearby_locations".
hw4: Had to simulate game of life (a popular zero-player game).
hw5: Had to implement a variety of clocks and counters using Classes.

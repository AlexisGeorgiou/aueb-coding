## Operations Research: 
Linear Programming: LP problem, Simplex Method (phase I and phase II), introduction to duality theory. Nonlinear programming, optimization with inequality constraints (the KarushKuhn-Tucker conditions), algorithmic implementation. Inventory theory: deterministic models (economic ordering quantity),
stochastic models, Dynamic programming and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver 4 math exercises. Used AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) mostly for maximizing problems.

## Distributed Systems: 
non-centralized systems, the client-server model. Event ordering and mutualexclusion, deadlocks and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to do one distributed system of a TikTok-like application with a group of classmates. We made the server transmit information between clients and build a UI on Android Studio. Used Java for the project.

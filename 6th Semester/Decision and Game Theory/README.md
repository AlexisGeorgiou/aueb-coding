## Decision and Game Theory:
probabilities, Decision problem, Decision trees, Bayes' theorem, Utility function determination, Competitive decisions, game trees. Two player games, zero and nonzero sum, Applications to auctions.
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver a mathematical exercise and a programming project.

**Exercise:** Had to solve some exercises related to the subject

**Project**:  Using python, I implemented voting games with various rules (Plurality/Borda) and then implemented a Best Response Dynamic algorithm, which is an algorithm that modifies the voter's vote depending also on his motive instead of his preference (for example someone could vote the second choice because voting for his best preference has no point since it's too low). This algorithm finds an equilibrium on the casted votes of the players.

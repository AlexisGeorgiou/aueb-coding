## Operations Research: 
Linear Programming: LP problem, Simplex Method (phase I and phase II), introduction to duality theory. Nonlinear programming, optimization with inequality constraints (the KarushKuhn-Tucker conditions), algorithmic implementation. Inventory theory: deterministic models (economic ordering quantity),
stochastic models, Dynamic programming and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver 4 math exercises. Used AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) mostly for maximizing problems.

## Topics in Discrete Mathematics: 
Theoretical course on Graph theory. Trees, Optimal spanning trees, Optimal paths and optimal spanning trees, Counting trees, Rooted
trees, Huffmanâ€™s algorithm, Paths and distances, Connectivity and construction of reliable communication networks,
Hamilton cycles, The traveling salesman problem, Euler trails, The Chinese postman problem and more topics related to graph theory. 

## Decision and Game Theory:
probabilities, Decision problem, Decision trees, Bayes' theorem, Utility function determination, Competitive decisions, game trees. Two player games, zero and nonzero sum, Applications to auctions.
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver a mathematical exercise and a programming project.

**Exercise:** Had to solve some exercises related to the subject

**Project**:  Using python, I implemented voting games with various rules (Plurality/Borda) and then implemented a Best Response Dynamic algorithm, which is an algorithm that modifies the voter's vote depending also on his motive instead of his preference (for example someone could vote the second choice because voting for his best preference has no point since it's too low). This algorithm finds an equilibrium on the casted votes of the players.

## Distributed Systems: 
non-centralized systems, the client-server model. Event ordering and mutualexclusion, deadlocks and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to do one distributed system of a TikTok-like application with a group of classmates. We made the server transmit information between clients and build a UI on Android Studio. Used Java for the project.

## Database Systems Design: 
Disks, Indexing, Hashing, Multi dimensions indices, queries, statistics in databases, histograms, sorting, joins, query optimizations, datewarehousing, transactaions. #### Projects: 
Had to do 2 exercises related to the theory of the course and 2 projects.On the projects I had to construct a database using SQL, optimizations, indexes.

**Project 1**: Used Microsoft SQL Server to implement a database using movie data. Constructed the database and the schema, created indexes that optimize certain queries

**Project 2**: Created a database similar to Project 1 using camp data. Constructed the database and implemented a star schema, made ER diagram, created various queries to answers questions, created complex 3 dimensional queries.

## Software Engineering:
Requirements, Use cases, UML diagrams, Domain Modeling, Sequence diagrams, Use case analysis, requirements specifications, architecture, design, junit testing, patterns and construction. 
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver 4 exercises related to software analysis in Java.

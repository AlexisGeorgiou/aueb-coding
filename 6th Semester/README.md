## Operations Research: 
Linear Programming: LP problem, Simplex Method (phase I and phase II), introduction to duality theory. Nonlinear programming, optimization with inequality constraints (the KarushKuhn-Tucker conditions), algorithmic implementation. Inventory theory: deterministic models (economic ordering quantity),
stochastic models, Dynamic programming and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver 4 math exercises.

## Topics in Discrete Mathematics: 
Theoretical course on Graph theory. Trees, Optimal spanning trees, Optimal paths and optimal spanning trees, Counting trees, Rooted
trees, Huffmanâ€™s algorithm, Paths and distances, Connectivity and construction of reliable communication networks,
Hamilton cycles, The traveling salesman problem, Euler trails, The Chinese postman problem and more topics related to graph theory. 

## Decision and Game Theory:
probabilities, Decision problem, Decision trees, Bayes' theorem, Utility function determination, Competitive decisions, game trees. Two player games, zero and nonzero sum, Applications to auctions.
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver a mathematical exercise and a programming project with a voting game and equilibriums.

## Distributed Systems: 
non-centralized systems, the client-server model. Event ordering and mutualexclusion, deadlocks and more. 
#### Projects: 
Had to do one distributed system of a tiktok like application with a group of classmates. We had to make the server transmit informaiton between clients and build a UI on Android Studio.

## Database Systems Design: 
Disks, Indexing, Hashing, Multi dimensions indices, queries, statistics in databases, histograms, sorting, joins, query optimizations, datewarehousing, transactaions. #### Projects:

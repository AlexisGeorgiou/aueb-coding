Had to do 2 exercises related to the theory of the course and 2 projects.On the projects I had to construct a database using SQL, optimizations, indexes.

**Project 1**: Used Microsoft SQL Server to implement a database using movie data. Constructed the database and the schema, created indexes that optimize certain queries

**Project 2**: Created a database similar to Project 1 using camp data. Constructed the database and implemented a star schema, made ER diagram, created various queries to answers questions, created complex 3 dimensional queries.

## Social Network Analysis: 
Graph theory, matrices, sparsity and density, centralities, degrees, communities, triadic closure, bridges, algorithms, hubs, pagerank, epidemic model, betweenness and more. Had to analyze a social network of my choice and all the statistics behind it. 
#### Projects: 
Had to create a network and analyze it with most of the techniques I learned in the class. Used Python libraries and Gephi network analysis software. Fetched edges and nodes from the internet. The network is consisted of cards and a connection between the cards in a popular game.

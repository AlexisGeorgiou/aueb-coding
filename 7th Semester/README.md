## Technologies and Programming of Web Applications: 
Web applications,client programming, browser programming. HTML, XML, CSS, XSL, Javascript. Object-Oriented Javascript, Event-driven programming, Asynchronous communication via AJAX, Client-server interaction technologies, REST Model and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to make an e-learning website that is connected to an API and provides data of various courses. The user can interact with the back-end by log-in, register and register for a course. Used HTML, CSS, Javascript for this project. Used express and node.js for the implemantation of the server. Implemented Client JS and fetching data from API, also inserting fetched data in the page dynamically.

## Machine Learning: 
General learning techniques with supervised and unsupervised learning. Cross-validation, Sampling and bootstrapping. Introduction to probabilistic modeling and statistical learning techniques, Linear regression and classification models, Nonlinear regression, nearest neighbors and Bayes'
theorem, Îšernel methods and support vector machines, Data clustering and the k-means algorithm and more.
#### Projects: 
Used machine learning techniques to provide a prediction for bitcoin price based on its price last five years. We used various techniques like linear/logistic regression and Neural Network. Also used normalization, scalers, cross validation and extracted statistics for each technique.   

## Social Network Analysis: 
Graph theory, matrices, sparsity and density, centralities, degrees, communities, triadic closure, bridges, algorithms, hubs, pagerank, epidemic model, betweenness and more. Had to analyze a social network of my choice and all the statistics behind it. 
#### Projects: 
Created a network and analyzed it with most of the techniques I learned in the class. Used Python libraries and Gephi network analysis software. Fetched edges and nodes from the internet. The network nodes are consisted of cards and the edges of the connection between nodes in a popular game.

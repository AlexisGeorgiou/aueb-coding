General learning techniques with supervised and unsupervised learning. Cross-validation, Sampling and bootstrapping. Introduction to probabilistic modeling and statistical learning techniques, Linear regression and classification models, Nonlinear regression, nearest neighbors and Bayes'
theorem, Îšernel methods and support vector machines, Data clustering and the k-means algorithm and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to use machine learning techniques to provide a prediction for bitcoin price based on its price last five years. We used various techniques like linear/logistic regression and Neural Network. We used normalization, scalers, cross validation and extracted statistics for each technique.

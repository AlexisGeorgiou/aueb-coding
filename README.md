In this repository, you can find all the projects that were assigned
during my AUEB Computer Science bachelor degree.

Not every course in the program had coding assignments. I have a brief description of each course I passed every semester.

I studied a variety of courses in the program and I prefered to choose database, machine learning and math related courses mainly as electives.

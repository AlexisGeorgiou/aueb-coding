## What's in here?
In this repository, you can find all the projects that I worked on during my [AUEB](https://www.aueb.gr/) Computer Science bachelor degree.
###### I have a brief description of each course in each folder. Not every course had coding assignments.
###### Courses are splitted by the semester I passed them.


## What courses can I find here?
As an undergraduate student I mostly chose electives from the below modules:

###### > Module 1: _"Databases and Knowledge Management"_ 
###### > Module 2: _"Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing"_

So apart from basic Computer Science, you will find courses mostly related to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, Mathematics, Databases, Theoretical Computer Science, Web development and more.

## Significant projects:
[Machine Learning](https://github.com/AlexisGeorgiou/aueb-courses/tree/main/7th%20Semester/Machine%20Learning)

[Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/AlexisGeorgiou/aueb-courses/tree/main/5th%20Semester/Artificial%20Intelligence)

[Web Development](https://github.com/AlexisGeorgiou/aueb-courses/tree/main/7th%20Semester/Technologies%20and%20Programming%20of%20Web%20Applications)

[Social Network Analysis](https://github.com/AlexisGeorgiou/aueb-courses/tree/main/7th%20Semester/Social%20Network%20Analysis)

There are a lot of more projects in the repository but I had to limit the number of significant ones.

## More info:
###### You can find the full curriculum and the syllabus of each course [here](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/sites/default/files/cs/CS_Manuals/CS_StudiesGuide2021-22_EN.pdf).
###### Some of the reports are written in Greek but most times the code and its comments are in english.
###### Some of the projects were made with the help of my colleagues as part of a group project. The names are written on project reports.
###### Not every course I passed is posted here, I tried to post only the most related to Computer Science.
###### There is nothing on the 8th semester because I finished my studies earlier.

## What's in here?
In this repository, you can find all the projects that I worked on during my [AUEB](https://www.aueb.gr/) Computer Science bachelor degree.
###### I have a brief description of each course in each folder. Not every course had coding assignments.
###### Courses are splitted by the semester I passed them.


## What courses will I find here?
As an undergraduate student I mostly chose electives from the below modules:

###### > Module 1: _"Databases and Knowledge Management"_ 
###### > Module 2: _"Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing"_

So apart from basic Computer Science, you will find courses mostly related to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, Mathematics, Databases, Theoretical Computer Science, Web development and more.

## Significant programming courses:


## More info:
###### Some of the projects were made with the help of my colleagues as part of a group project. The names are written on each file project.
###### You can find the full curriculum and the syllabus of each course [here](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/sites/default/files/cs/CS_Manuals/CS_StudiesGuide2021-22_EN.pdf).
###### There is nothing on the 8th semester because I finished my studies earlier.

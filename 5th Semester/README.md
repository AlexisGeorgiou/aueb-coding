#### Projects: 
Had to deliver exercises every week.
 
## Communication Networks: Key concepts and principles of communication networks. Network hardware and software, reference models, review of existing
networks. Physical layer, Data link layer, Network layer, TCP/IP protocol family, Internet addresses and subnetting, control protocols, routing algorithms, Transport layer and more.

## Artificial Intelligence: 
Turing test, Problem-solving by search: breadth/depth-first, A*, hill climbing, beam search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, MiniMax, alpha-beta pruning, Machine learning, k-nearest neighbors, k-means, Na√Øve Bayes, entropy, feature selection, overfitting, ID3,
linear regression, gradient descent, logistic regression, Perceptron, neural networks, back-propagation and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to do two big group projects.
In the first project we had to create an othello game and make an AI opponent, we used Java for this.
In the second project we had to implement 3 AI algorithms, (Bayes, ID3, logistic regression). We had train data for negative and positive reviews and we had to categorize the test data reviews.

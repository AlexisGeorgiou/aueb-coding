## Information Systems Analysis and Design: 
IS development lifecycle, organizational processes, requirements analysis, modelling functions (SADT, IDEF0, DFD, decision tables and trees), modeling data
(E-R diagrams), introduction to UML. IS architectures, quality assurance, project management. Case studies and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to deliver exercises every week related to the subject. Most of them required diagrams and I used draw.io

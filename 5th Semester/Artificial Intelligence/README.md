## Artificial Intelligence: 
Turing test, Problem-solving by search: breadth/depth-first, A*, hill climbing, beam search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, MiniMax, alpha-beta pruning, Machine learning, k-nearest neighbors, k-means, Na√Øve Bayes, entropy, feature selection, overfitting, ID3,
linear regression, gradient descent, logistic regression, Perceptron, neural networks, back-propagation and more.
#### Projects: 
Had to do two big group projects.

**Project 1:** We had to create the othello game and make an AI opponent, we used Java for this. Implemented Board and Move classes and a Gameplayer class for the AI, used the MiniMax algorithm for the AI player.

**Project 2:** We had to implement 3 AI algorithms from scratch, (Bayes, ID3, logistic regression). We were given train data for negative and positive reviews and we had to read them, train the model and categorize the test data reviews in the same categories. Then we extracted statistics for each algorithm and parameter (created related diagrams) to see what works best.
